From data cleanup to normalization, FinOps hubs do the work so you can focus on driving business value.

FinOps hubs perform a number of data processing activities to clean up, normalize, and optimize data. The following diagram shows how data flows from Cost Management into a hub instance:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Cost Management->>msexports: ① Export data
    msexports->>msexports: ② msexports_ExecuteETL
    msexports->>ingestion: ② msexports_ETL_ingestion
    Power BI-->>ingestion: ③ Read data
```

<br>

1. Cost Management exports raw cost details to the **msexports** container.
2. The **msexports_ExecuteETL** pipeline kicks off the extract-transform-load (ETL) process when files are added to storage.
3. The **msexports_ETL_ingestion** pipeline transforms the data to a standard schema and saves the raw data in parquet format to the **ingestion** container.
4. Power BI reads cost data from the **ingestion** container.
